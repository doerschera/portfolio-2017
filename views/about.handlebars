  <p class="about tracking-kerning">
    Iâ€™m a frontend developer with a background in art and design. I received a BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design and spent a year in the Master of Architecture program at the University of Michigan. I started programming while in architecture school and quickly discovered it was my perfect medium. I left architecture and have never looked back. I love mixing logic with aesthetics to create elegant and dynamic sites. In my free time I relax with podcasts and a purring cat.
